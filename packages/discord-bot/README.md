**NOTE***
This guide does currently not cover everything that should be done to set up the project. It misses important information about for example the bot's settings and that you need to run [Arora API](https://github.com/guidojw/arora-api) for the group commands.
I am currently in the process of making the bot easier to set up and understand. You can follow the progress in the [issues list](https://github.com/guidojw/arora-discord/issues) and [milestones list](https://github.com/guidojw/arora-discord/milestones). Once all this progress is finished, this guide will be changed to properly cover the whole setting up process! 

Glitch and repl.it will probably not be supported for these projects as you need to be able to run things like a database and more.
